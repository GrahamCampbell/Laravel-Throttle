## Installation

[PHP](https://php.net) 5.4+ or [HHVM](http://hhvm.com) 3.3+, and [Composer](https://getcomposer.org) are required.

To get the latest version of Laravel Throttle, simply add the following line to the require block of your `composer.json` file:

```
"graham-campbell/throttle": "~3.0"
```

You'll then need to run `composer install` or `composer update` to download it and have the autoloader updated.

Once Laravel Throttle is installed, you need to register the service provider. Open up `config/app.php` and add the following to the `providers` key.

* `'GrahamCampbell\Throttle\ThrottleServiceProvider'`

You can register the Throttle facade in the `aliases` key of your `config/app.php` file if you like.

* `'Throttle' => 'GrahamCampbell\Throttle\Facades\Throttle'`

#### Looking for a laravel 4 compatable version?

Checkout the [2.0 branch](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Throttle/tree/2.0), installable by requiring `"graham-campbell/throttle": "~2.0"`.


## Configuration

Laravel Throttle supports optional configuration.

To get started, first publish the package config file:

```bash
$ php artisan publish:config graham-campbell/throttle
```

There is one config option:

##### Cache Driver

This option (`'driver'`) defines the cache driver to be used. It may be the name of any driver set in config/cache.php. Setting it to null will use the driver you have set as default in config/cache.php. Please note that a driver that supports cache tags is required. The default value for this setting is `null`.


## Usage

##### Throttle

This is the class of most interest. It is bound to the ioc container as `'throttle'` and can be accessed using the `Facades\Throttle` facade. There are six public methods of interest.

The `'get'` method will create a new throttler class (a class that implements `Throttler\ThrottlerInterface`) from the 1-3 parameters that you pass to it. The first parameter is required and must either an instance of `\Illuminate\Http\Request`, or an associative array with two keys (`'ip'` should be the ip address of the user you wish to throttle and `'route'` should be the full url you wish to throttle, but actually, for advanced usage, may be any unique key you choose). The second parameter is optional and should be an `int` which represents the maximum number of hits that are allowed before the user hits the limit. The third and final parameter should be an `int` that represents the time the user must wait after going over the limit before the hit count will be reset to zero. Under the hood this method will be calling the make method on a throttler factory class (a class that implements `Factories\FactoryInterface`).

The other 5 methods all accept the same parameters as the `get` method. What happens here is we dynamically create a throttler class (or we automatically reuse an instance we already created), and then we call the method on it with no parameters. These 5 methods are `'attempt'`, `'hit'`, `'clear'`, `'count'`, and `'check'`. They are all documented bellow.

##### Facades\Throttle

This facade will dynamically pass static method calls to the `'throttle'` object in the ioc container which by default is the `Throttle` class.

##### Throttler\ThrottlerInterface

This interface defines the public methods a throttler class must implement. All 5 methods here accept no parameters.

The `'attempt'` method will hit the throttle (increment the hit count), and then will return a boolean representing whether or not the hit limit has been exceeded.

The `'hit'` method will hit the throttle (increment the hit count), and the will return `$this` so you can make another method call if you so choose.

The `'clear'` method will clear the throttle (set the hit count to zero), and the will return `$this` so you can make another method call if you so choose.

The `'count'` method will return the number of hits to the throttle.

The `'check'` method will return a boolean representing whether or not the hit limit has been exceeded.

##### Throttler\CacheThrottler

This class implements `Throttler\ThrottlerInterface` completely. This is the only throttler implementation shipped with this package, and in created by the `Factories\CacheFactory` class. Note that this class also implements PHP's `Countable` interface.

##### Factories\FactoryInterface

This interface defines the public methods a throttler factory class must implement. Such a class must only implement one method.

The `'make'` method will create a new throttler class (a class that implements `Throttler\ThrottlerInterface`) from data object you pass to it. This documentation of an internal interface is included for advanced users who may wish to write their own factory classes to make their own custom throttler classes.

##### Factories\CacheFactory

This class implements `Factories\FactoryInterface` completely. This is the only throttler implementation shipped with this package, and is responsible for creating the `Factories\CacheFactory` class. This class is only intended for internal use by the `Throttle` class.

##### ThrottleServiceProvider

This class contains no public methods of interest. This class should be added to the providers array in `config/app.php`. This class will setup ioc bindings.

##### Filters

You may put the `throttle` filter in front of your routes to throttle them. The filter can take up to two parameters. The two parameters are `limit` and `time`. It may be useful for you to take a look at the [source](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Throttle/blob/master/src/filters.php) for this, read the [tests](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Throttle/blob/master/tests/Functional/FilterTest.php), or check out Laravel's [documentation](http://laravel.com/docs/routing#route-filters) if you need to.


##### Real Examples

Here you can see an example of just how simple this package is to use.

Our first example will be a super simple usage of our default filter. This will setup a filter for that url with a limit of 10 hits and a retention time of 1 hour.

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('foo', array('before' => 'throttle', function () {
    return 'Why herro there!';
}, ));
```

What if we want custom limits? Easy! Laravel allows us to pass parameters to a filters. This will setup a filter for that url with a limit of 50 hits and a retention time of 30 mins.

```php
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Route;

Route::get('foo', array('before' => 'throttle:50,30', function () {
    return 'Why herro there!';
}, ));
```

What if we don't want to use the default filters provided with this package? Well, that's easy too.

```php
use GrahamCampbell\Throttle\Facades\Throttle;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Request;

// let's quickly get the current request object
$request = Request::getFacadeRoot();

// now let's get a throttler object for that request
// we'll use the same config as in the previous example
// note that only the first parameter is "required"
$throttler = Throttle::get($request, 50, 30);

// let's check if we've gone over the limit
var_dump($thottler->check());

// we implement Countable
var_dump(count($thottler));

// there are a few more functions available
// please see the previous documentation
```

Also note that you can call methods straight on the factory instead of calling the get method.

```php
use GrahamCampbell\Throttle\Facades\Throttle;
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Request;

$request = Request::getFacadeRoot();

// the attempt function will hit the throttle, then return check
var_dump(Throttle::attempt($request));

// so this is the same as writing
var_dump(Throttle::hit($request)->check());

// and, of course, the same as
var_dump(Throttle::get($request)->attempt());
```

Example for using Laravel 5 Middlewares.

```
namespace App\Http\Middleware;

use Closure;
use GrahamCampbell\Throttle\Throttle;
use Illuminate\Contracts\Routing\Middleware;
use Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\TooManyRequestsHttpException;

class RateLimitMiddleware implements Middleware
{
    /**
     * The throttle instance.
     *
     * @var \GrahamCampbell\Throttle\Throttle
     */
    protected $throttle;

    /**
     * Create a new instance.
     *
     * @param \GrahamCampbell\Throttle\Throttle $throttle
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function __construct(Throttle $throttle)
    {
        $this->throttle = $throttle;
    }

    /**
     * Handle an incoming request.
     *
     * @param \Illuminate\Http\Request $request
     * @param \Closure                 $next
     *
     * @throws \Symfony\Component\HttpKernel\Exception\TooManyRequestsHttpException
     *
     * @return mixed
     */
    public function handle($request, Closure $next)
    {
        $limit = 10; // request limit
        $time = 30; // ban time

        if (false === $this->throttle->attempt($request, $limit, $time)) {
            throw new TooManyRequestsHttpException($time * 60, 'Rate limit exceed.');
        }

        return $next($request);
    }
}
```

##### Further Information

There are other classes in this package that are not documented here (such as the transformers). This is because they are not intended for public use and are used internally by this package.

Feel free to check out the [API Documentation](http://docs.grahamjcampbell.co.uk) for Laravel Throttle.

You may see an example of implementation in [Laravel Credentials](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Laravel-Credentials) and [Bootstrap CMS](https://github.com/GrahamCampbell/Bootstrap-CMS).
